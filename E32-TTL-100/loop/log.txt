	Received RREQ:
		- check if received reversed path (ACK): [TODO] TURN OFF TIMER, no need to wait for ACK anymore
		- check if duplicate (received_broadcast_table[])
		- update received_broadcast_table
		[TODO]- check if destination -> yes, unicast RREP	
		- check if destination -> no:
			+ UNICAST ACK TO SENDER
			+ update routing table
			+ rebroadcast: hop_count++; sender_address: changed

03/12/2019:
	- fix LoRa_broadcast(); delete _E32_LoRa_broadcast();
	- add api: LoRa_unicast(), unicast_RREQ_ACK()
	- TEST: find sizeof(pointer)?
		uint8_t* message
		sizeof(message)?
		--> _sizeof(uint8_t* message);
	- change position of: check destination
	- unicast RREP to source: if received_broadcast: its address == RREQ.dest_address
	- [TODO] if received RREP_message
